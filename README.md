## Developing Embedded code for Garden monitoring with BLE Alerts

- Material:
  - ESP32 or ESP8266 (Code examples for both will be included in the repo).
  - Soil Moisture Sensors
  - DHT11 (Humidity and Temperature Sensor)
  - UV Sensor

- Phase 1:
  - Measuring Soil Moisture in each of my pots
  - Send data to AWS IoT Core
- Phase 2:
  - Display data on a Display
  - Save data to a DB
- Phase 3:
  - Display data in a Web Application
- Phase 4:
  - Send data via BLE to receive alerts about the watering of your plants
